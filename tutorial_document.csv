"Staging Content for Later"
"","You can prepare content for future use by placing it outside the required columns.","An item is only included in a lesson when both the 'Question' (column B) and 'Answer' (column C) are filled in."
"","For later - just move this to columns B and C when you're ready.","This item is not yet active in lessons."
"","Another one for later - move it to columns B and C when it's ready.","This way, you can build a backlog of learning material without it appearing in your lessons right away."
