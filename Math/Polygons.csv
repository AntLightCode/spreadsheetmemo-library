"In a parallelogram, one side is 5 cm longer than the other, and its perimeter is 38 cm. Calculate the lengths of the sides of this parallelogram",7 cm and 12 cm,"Given: 
* perimeter = 38 cm
* difference between sides = 5 cm
Solution:
2a + 2b = 38, so a + b = 19
b = a + 5
a + (a + 5) = 19 → 2a = 14 → a = 7 cm, b = 12 cm

Answer: 7 cm and 12 cm",,
"The perimeter of a parallelogram is 64 cm, and one of its sides is 3 times shorter than the other. Find the lengths of the adjacent sides of this parallelogram",8 cm and 24 cm,"Given: 
* perimeter = 64 cm
* one side is 1/3 the length of the other
Solution:
2a + 2b = 64, so a + b = 32
b = 3a
a + 3a = 32 → 4a = 32 → a = 8 cm, b = 24 cm

Answer: 8 cm and 24 cm",,
A rhombus has a side length of 60 cm. A parallelogram with the same perimeter has sides that differ by 20 cm. Determine the dimensions of the parallelogram,50 cm and 70 cm,"Given: 
* rhombus side = 60 cm
* parallelogram has the same perimeter
* difference between sides = 20 cm
Solution:
* Rhombus perimeter = 4 x 60 = 240 cm
* For the parallelogram: a + b = 120, b - a = 20
* b = a + 20 → a + (a + 20) = 120 → 2a = 100 → a = 50 cm, b = 70 cm
Answer: 50 cm and 70 cm",,
One side of a parallelogram is 7 cm shorter than the other. What are the lengths of the sides if the perimeter is 50 cm?,9 cm and 16 cm,"Given: 
* perimeter = 50 cm
* difference between sides = 7 cm
Solution:
a + b = 25, b - a = 7
b = a + 7 → a + (a + 7) = 25 → 2a = 18 → a = 9 cm, b = 16 cm

Answer: 9 cm and 16 cm",,
An obtuse angle in a rhombus is twice the measure of the acute angle. Provide the measures of all angles of this rhombus,"60°, 120°, 60°, 120°","Given: 
* In a rhombus, the obtuse angle is 2 times the acute angle

The perimeter of an isosceles trapezoid is 1 m. The sum of the lengths of its bases is 68 cm. What is the length of the leg of this trapezoid?,16 cm,"Given:
* perimeter = 100 cm
* sum of bases = 68 cm
Solution:
Perimeter = a + b + 2r = 100
a + b = 68
68 + 2r = 100 → 2r = 32 → r = 16 cm

Answer: 16 cm",,
The perimeter of a right trapezoid is 36 cm. The shorter leg and the shorter base are the same length and together they measure 12 cm. The longer base is 4 cm longer than the other leg. Calculate the length of the longer leg,10 cm,"Given:
* perimeter = 36 cm
* shorter leg + shorter base = 12 cm
* longer base is 4 cm longer than the other leg
Solution:
Let:
* a = shorter base
* r₁ = shorter leg (perpendicular)
* r₂ = longer leg
* b = longer base
a = r₁ and a + r₁ = 12 → 2a = 12 → a = r₁ = 6 cm
b = r₂ + 4

Perimeter: 6 + 6 + r₂ + (r₂ + 4) = 36 → 16 + 2r₂ = 36 → r₂ = 10 cm

Answer: 10 cm",,
