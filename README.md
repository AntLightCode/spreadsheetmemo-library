## What is SpreadsheetMemo?

![SpreadsheetMemo Hero](https://spreadsheetmemo.com/assets/images/hero-bg.png)

**SpreadsheetMemo** is a flashcard-based learning web application that uses the power of Google Sheets to store your content, allowing you to memorize things quickly and effectively.

Flashcards can contain vocabulary, historical dates, chemical element names, math/physics equations, or even types of dinosaurs 🦕 Simply put, any subject that can be learned in a question-and-answer format.

You can use it for your studies, as a preparation tool, to check your knowledge before an exam, or to practice new vocabulary.

## How It Works

**Two-Round Learning System**
- **First Round (Initial)**: Check your memory's performance by revealing answers and rating difficulty
- Rate each card: "I Knew It" ✅ or "I Didn't Know" ❌
- **Second Round (Final)**: Review and reinforce new or challenging items
