"What is the Fourier transform?

Advanced example of using the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wiki_markup Wiki Markup] and the [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics TeX] formulas","The Fourier transform is a function derived from a given function and representing it by a series of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave sinusoidal] functions.","====Definition====
The Fourier transform of the function \(f\) is traditionally denoted by adding a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumflex circumflex]: \(\hat{f}\). There are several common conventions for defining the Fourier transform of an integrable function \(f : \mathbb R \rightarrow \mathbb C\). Definition for any real number ξ:
\[\hat{f}(\xi) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)\ e^{- 2\pi i x \xi}\,dx\]
When the independent variable x represents time (with SI unit of seconds), the transform variable ξ represents frequency (in hertz).

Under suitable conditions, \(f\) is determined by \(\hat f\) via the inverse transform:
\(f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \hat f(\xi)\ e^{2 \pi i \xi x}\,d\xi\), for any real number x.
===== Basic properties=====
# Linearity
** For any [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number complex numbers] a and b, if h(x) = af(x) + bg(x), then  \(\hat{h}(\xi)=a\cdot \hat{f}(\xi) + b\cdot\hat{g}(\xi).\)
# Time Scaling
** For a non-zero [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number real number] a, if \(h(x)=f(ax)\), then  \(\hat{h}(\xi)=\frac{1}{|a|}\hat{f}\left(\frac{\xi}{a}\right).\) The case a = -1 leads to the time-reversal property, which states: if h(x) = f(-x), then \(\hat{h}(\xi)=\hat{f}(-\xi).\)

"How can you remove a SpreadsheetMemo document from the app's list view without deleting it?","Just rename it!

Remove or change the `''SpreadsheetMemo:''` prefix in the document's name.","The app only lists Google Sheets files that have `'''SpreadsheetMemo:'''` at the beginning of their name and were created by the app.

For example:

"How to prevent specific questions from being swapped with answers?~#no-swap#~","Add the special tag to the question or answer.","The ""Bidirectional"" and ""Swap"" options are great for learning vocabulary, but for fill-in-the-blank questions (e.g., ''Would you like ⬜ coffee?''), swapping the question with the answer (''some'') doesn't make sense.

To prevent a specific pair from being swapped, simply add the '''~#no-swap#~''' tag to either the question or the answer column. The app will automatically skip this item during randomization, and the tag itself will not be visible during the lesson.","",""
