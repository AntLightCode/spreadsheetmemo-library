"What is the Fourier transform?

Advanced example of using the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wiki_markup Wiki Markup] and the [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics TeX] formulas","The Fourier transform is a function derived from a given function and representing it by a series of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave sinusoidal] functions.","====Definition====
The Fourier transform of the function \(f\) is traditionally denoted by adding a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumflex circumflex]: \(\hat{f}\). There are several common conventions for defining the Fourier transform of an integrable function \(f : \mathbb R \rightarrow \mathbb C\). Definition for any real number ξ:
\[\hat{f}(\xi) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)\ e^{- 2\pi i x \xi}\,dx\]
When the independent variable x represents time (with SI unit of seconds), the transform variable ξ represents frequency (in hertz).

Under suitable conditions, \(f\) is determined by \(\hat f\) via the inverse transform:
\(f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \hat f(\xi)\ e^{2 \pi i \xi x}\,d\xi\), for any real number x.
===== Basic properties=====
# Linearity
** For any [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number complex numbers] a and b, if h(x) = af(x) + bg(x), then  \(\hat{h}(\xi)=a\cdot \hat{f}(\xi) + b\cdot\hat{g}(\xi).\)
# Time Scaling
** For a non-zero [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number real number] a, if \(h(x)=f(ax)\), then  \(\hat{h}(\xi)=\frac{1}{|a|}\hat{f}\left(\frac{\xi}{a}\right).\) The case a = -1 leads to the time-reversal property, which states: if h(x) = f(-x), then \(\hat{h}(\xi)=\hat{f}(-\xi).\)

"Tips & Tricks"
"How can you remove a SpreadsheetMemo document from the app's list view without deleting it?","Just rename it!

Remove or change the `''SpreadsheetMemo:''` prefix in the document's name.","The app only lists Google Sheets files that have `'''SpreadsheetMemo:'''` at the beginning of their name and were created by the app.

For example:
* `'''SpreadsheetMemo: My Vocab'''` → will be listed
* `'''SpreadsheetMemoArch: My Vocab'''` → will '''not''' be listed
* `'''My Vocab'''` → will '''not''' be listed","https://support.google.com/docs/answer/49114#zippy=%2Crename-a-file"
"How to prevent specific questions from being swapped with answers?","Add the special tag to the question or answer.","The options to swap questions with answers, available in the '''Bidirectional''' settings, are great for learning vocabulary. However, for fill-in-the-blank questions (e.g., ''Would you like ⬜ coffee?''), swapping the question with the answer (''some'') doesn't make sense.

To prevent a specific pair from being swapped, simply add the '''~#no-swap#~''' tag to either the question, the answer, or the notes column. The app will automatically exclude this item from the swapping process, and the tag itself will not be visible during the lesson.",,,~#no-swap#~
""
"Staging Content for Later"
"","You can prepare content for future use by placing it outside the required columns.","An item is only included in a lesson when both the 'Question' (column B) and 'Answer' (column C) are filled in."
"","For later - just move this to columns B and C when you're ready.","This item is not yet active in lessons."
"","Another one for later - move it to columns B and C when it's ready.","This way, you can build a backlog of learning material without it appearing in your lessons right away."
""
"Add new content, jump back to the SpreadsheetMemo app, and start your next lesson.
Make it your daily routine.","You will feel the difference after a few days - just be systematic.","","","https://res.cloudinary.com/antlightcode/image/upload/v1762367309/spreadsheetmemo_app/hero-bg_wq.png"
